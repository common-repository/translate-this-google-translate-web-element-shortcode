1. Use the shortcode `[translate_this][/translate_this]`

* `lang="xx"` - **Required.** Where xx is the two character language code (i.e. en for English).
* `background="#XXXXXX"` - *Optional.*  Where #XXXXXXX is a hexadecimal color code. Defaults to *transparent*.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Why doesn't it work?

The default base language is English.  If you put the short code around a block of English it doesn't need to translate it.
Also, check the two character language code is supported by Google Translate.  Make sure you have the *lang* parameter in there and the value is language you want to translate from.
